Welcome to Articulate!

Find Your Voice…

Public speaking is hard. We here at articulate strive to make sure that what you want to say, is what your audience will hear. Nervous about a speech, presentation, or perhaps an email to your boss? Run it by us. Using IBM Watson’s Language API’s we’ll analyze your ideas and give you easy to understand feedback.

Registration is optional, but we’d like to get to know you better. If you do choose to sign up, the more you use Articulate, the more personal your feedback will become. We know everyone is different. That’s why each registered user result is compared to their overall average. We don’t want you to just understand our feedback, we want you to understand HOW we got there.

Speak Clearly, Speak Confidently, Articulate!
