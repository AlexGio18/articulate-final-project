<h4> Our Purpose </h4>
<p>Public speaking is hard. We here at articulate strive to make sure that what you want to say, is what your audience will hear. Nervous about a speech, presentation, or perhaps an email to your boss? Run it by us. Utilizing IBM Watson’s Alchemy Language API and Tone Analyzer, we will analyze your ideas to give you easy to understand feedback.
